## AI Summary Tips

### When to Use AI Summaries

- **Long videos** (30+ minutes) - Get overview before diving in
- **Multiple videos** - Compare content across videos quickly
- **Time-sensitive** - Need info fast without watching
- **Content curation** - Deciding if video is worth watching
- **Social sharing** - Quick takeaways for posts

### When NOT to Use AI Summaries

- **Short videos** (<5 minutes) - Just read the transcript
- **Technical accuracy needed** - Read full transcript for precision
- **Legal/medical content** - Summarization may miss critical details
- **Creative content** - Poetry, art, etc. lose meaning when summarized

### Improving AI Summary Quality

The AI works best when the video transcript:
- Is well-structured with clear points
- Has good grammar (manual captions better than auto)
- Discusses concrete topics vs abstract concepts
- Is in English (primary language supported)
